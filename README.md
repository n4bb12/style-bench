## ‚è± Test pages for comparing styling options

The need for this project arose from wanting to more intuitively understand the performance implications of using the `sx` prop with MUI stystem.
There is already a much better [Browser benchmark](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/benchmark/browser) by the MUI team that compares MUI styling options.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal playground project for learning when things start to become slow with MUI and how those scenarios compare if a different styling method were used.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
